<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have recently decided to launch my own website.<br/>
   As such, I am embarking on the adventure that is learning HTML and CSS from scratch,<br>
    so that i can use this to further develop my site as time goes by.</p>

<p>This is a brand new skill to me and is like nothing I have done before.<br>
My background lies within the trade of Pipefitting, and mainly spent<br>
working for BAE Systems Submarines</p>

<p>I will continue to update this page as my journey continues....</p>
